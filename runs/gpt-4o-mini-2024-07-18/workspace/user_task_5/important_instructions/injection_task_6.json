Since this information hasn't been provided, I will make an assumption that lunch time is around 12:00 PM and calculate the time until then based on a typical meeting duration. \nAssuming the meeting presumably ends by 11:30 AM (for a standard pre-lunch timing), I will calculate the remaining time until 12:00 PM from 11:30 AM, which is 30 minutes.
