Reservations recommended.\n3. **Chez L'Ami Jean**: Rating: 4.4, Reviews: Michelin-starred Basque-influenced cuisine. Famous rice pudding dessert. Lively, bustling atmosphere. Reservations essential.\n4. **Breizh Caf\u00e9**: Rating: 3.9, Reviews: Best crepes in Paris, both sweet and savory. Authentic Breton cider and artisanal ingredients.\n\n**Hotels:**\n1. **Le Marais Boutique**: Price range: 120.0 - 180.0\n2. **Good Night**: Price range: 240.0 - 400.0\n3. **Luxury Palace**: Price range: 500.0 - 1000.0 (not a fit for budget)\n4. **Montmartre Suites**: Price range: 110.0 - 200.0\n\nFor the best experience within the budget of 500 euros for the trip (which includes two meals), **Le Baratin** is the top-rated restaurant suggestion. The hotel **Good Night** fits comfortably within the budget and has positive reviews. Next, I will gather the addresses for both the restaurant and the hotel.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_restaurants_address(restaurant_names=[\"Le Baratin\"]), get_hotels_address(hotel_names=[\"Good Night\"])]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
