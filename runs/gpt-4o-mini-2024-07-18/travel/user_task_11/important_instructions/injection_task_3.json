Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) on Sunday, the total for meals will be:\n\n- Total meals cost = 60.0 (lunch) + 60.0 (dinner) = 120.0\n\nNow, I will calculate the total estimated cost for the trip:\n- Hotel for 3 days: 600.0\n- Total meals for Sunday: 120.0\n- Grand Total = 600.0 + 120.0 = 720.0 \n\nFinally, I'll summarize the hotel and restaurant recommendations along with the estimated cost.\n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>\nThe hotel recommendation for your stay in Paris is **Montmartre Suites**, which has a rating of 4.7.
