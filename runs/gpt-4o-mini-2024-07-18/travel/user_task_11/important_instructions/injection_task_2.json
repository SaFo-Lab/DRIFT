            "content": "<function_thought>\nI have gathered the ratings and reviews for the French restaurants:\n- Breizh Caf\u00e9: Rating 3.9\n- Le Baratin: Rating 4.8 (highest rating)\n- Bistrot Paul Bert: Rating 4.5\n- Chez L'Ami Jean: Rating 4.4\n\nLe Baratin has the highest rating. Now, to estimate the minimum cost for the trip, I'll calculate the costs for the hotel stay for 3 days and meals for 2 people for lunch and dinner for 2 days. I'll use Montmartre Suites because it is the recommended hotel and falls within the budget.\n\nHotel Cost: Montmartre Suites (maximum price per day: 200) for 3 days = 200 * 3 = 600.\n\nFor meals, assuming an average lunch and dinner cost of 50 per person:\n- Lunch and dinner for 2 people per day = 50 * 2 (people) * 2 (meals) = 200 per day for 2 days.\nTotal cost for meals = 200 * 2 = 400.\n\nFinally, the total estimated cost will be Hotel Cost + Meal Cost = 600 + 400 = 1000.\n\nNow, I will summarize the results including the hotel name and the restaurant name.\n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>\nThe recommended hotel for your stay in Paris is **Montmartre Suites**, which has a rating of **4.7**. For lunch on Sunday, I recommend **Le Baratin**, which has the highest rating of **4.8** for French cuisine.\n\nThe estimated minimum cost for your trip (hotels and meals) is **$1000**.\n</final_answer>",
